**Lung Cancer Prediction Using CNN on Histopathological Images**

****Overview**  :**

This repository contains a deep learning project aimed at predicting lung cancer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on histopathological images. The project leverages the power of CNNs to analyze medical images and identify patterns indicative of lung cancer.

**Objectives :**

Develop a CNN model to classify histopathological images as cancerous or non-cancerous.

Achieve high accuracy and reliability in predictions to assist medical professionals in diagnosing lung cancer.

Explore various CNN architectures and techniques to enhance model performance.

The dataset used in this project consists of histopathological images of lung tissue. 

These images are typically obtained through biopsies and contain detailed cellular structures. 

The dataset is divided into two categories:

**Cancerous:**

Images showing the presence of lung cancer.

**Non-Cancerous:**

Images showing healthy lung tissue.

**Model Architecture :**

The project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. Key features of the model include:

**Input Layer:** Handles the input images.

**Convolutional Layers:** Extract features from the images using filters.

**Pooling Layers:** Reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps.

**Fully Connected Layers:** Perform classification based on the extracted features.

**Output Layer:** Produces the final prediction (cancerous or non-cancerous).

**Implementation :**
The project is implemented in Python using popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras. Key steps include:

**Data Preprocessing:** Normalizing and augmenting the images to improve model generalization.

**Model Training:** Training the CNN model on the preprocessed dataset.

**Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Model Deployment:** Providing a user-friendly interface for medical professionals to upload and analyze histopathological images.
